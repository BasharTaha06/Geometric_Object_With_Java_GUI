                                                                             Geometric Object Project



A Java-based application to calculate the area and perimeter of various geometric shapes,including 
squares, rectangles, and triangles. The project was developed with Object-Oriented Programming 
(OOP) principles, providing a clear and modular design that makes it easy to add new shapes or extend 
functionality.

 Features

- Calculate Area and Perimeter: Quickly calculate the area and perimeter for squares, rectangles, and triangles.
- Modular Design: Built with OOP concepts, enabling easy modifications and extensions.
- Simple GUI: A user-friendly graphical interface to input shape parameters and view results.

 Technologies Used

- Java: The primary language used for the application.
- Java Swing (or other GUI framework used): For the graphical user interface.
- OOP Principles: Implementation follows OOP concepts, promoting modularity and reusability.

Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/geometric-object-project.git
  
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
4. Build and run the application.

Usage

1. Run the application.
2. Select the shape type (Square, Rectangle, or Triangle).
3. Input the necessary dimensions (like side lengths, base, height, etc.).
4. Click "Calculate" to view the area and perimeter.
